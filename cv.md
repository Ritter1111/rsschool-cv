### About me

I am 19 years old, a student at the National Aviation University, majoring in Computer Science. I would like to get more experience in frontend development, as this is what I want to do in life. Usually i spend my leisure time on learning new technologies and improving old ones. Critical thinking, ability to push-back and evaluate technical decisions. Responsibility and result orientation.

#### DESCRIPTION:

##### The Hamming Distance is a measure of similarity between two strings of equal length. Complete the function so that it returns the number of positions where the input strings do not match.

```
function hamming(a,b) {
	// Implement me!
  let count = 0
  for(let i=0; i<a.length; i++){
    if(a[i] !== b[i]){
      count++
    }
  }
  return count
}
```
